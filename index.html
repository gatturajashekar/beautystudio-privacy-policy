<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective Date: January 1, 2026</p>

<div class="highlight">
Madhu’s Beauty Studio is committed to protecting your personal information. 
We collect only the minimum data necessary to operate appointment booking 
and loyalty services securely and professionally. We do not sell, rent, or trade personal data.
</div>

<h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to the Madhu Beauty Studio mobile application (“App”), 
operated by Madhu’s Beauty Studio, a registered women-owned business located 
in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have 
read and understood this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Madhu’s Beauty Studio</strong><br>
Hyderabad, Telangana, India<br>
Email: <a href="mailto:madhubeautystudio@gmail.com">madhubeautystudio@gmail.com</a>
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>The App collects the following categories of personal information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Phone number (used for secure authentication)</li>
<li>Age range (between 13–120)</li>
<li>Gender (if voluntarily provided)</li>
<li>Booking history and selected services</li>
<li>Loyalty and referral records</li>
<li>Device notification token (for push notifications)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not collect payment card information, precise location data, biometric identifiers, 
or other sensitive personal data through the App.
</p>

<h2>3. Why We Collect Your Information</h2>
<p>
Your personal information is processed solely to provide salon appointment services, 
manage bookings, send confirmations and reminders, operate the loyalty program, 
prevent misuse, and improve service reliability. We do not use your data for 
automated profiling or automated decision-making.
</p>

<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
<p>
We process personal data based on user consent at registration, performance of services 
requested through the App, legitimate business interests necessary to operate securely, 
and compliance with applicable legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>5. Loyalty Program Information</h2>
<p>
The App includes a promotional loyalty system. One hundred (100) coins are equal to 
₹1 for redemption purposes. Coins are awarded only after completed bookings and may be 
reversed for cancellations, incomplete services, misuse, or technical error. 
Coins are non-transferable, non-withdrawable, and have no independent cash value outside the App.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
<p>
To operate securely, we use trusted infrastructure providers for authentication, 
push notifications, and cloud hosting services. These providers may process limited 
technical data on our behalf and may operate secure data centers outside India. 
All such processing is conducted under industry-standard safeguards.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards 
to protect personal information from unauthorized access or misuse. However, 
no digital system can guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention and Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
Personal data is retained while your account remains active. Users may delete their 
account directly within the App. Upon deletion request, the account enters a scheduled 
deletion process. A temporary recovery window of approximately 1–2 hours may apply. 
After this period, deletion becomes permanent and personal data cannot be restored. 
Certain limited records may be retained if legally required.
</p>

<h2>9. Fraud Prevention and Service Integrity</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to monitor App activity to prevent abuse of booking systems, 
loyalty rewards, or referral programs. Accounts involved in fraudulent activity 
may be restricted or terminated.
</p>

<h2>10. Service Availability</h2>
<p>
While we strive to maintain reliable service, we do not guarantee uninterrupted, 
error-free, or secure operation of the App at all times. Temporary interruptions 
may occur due to maintenance, technical issues, or third-party service disruptions.
</p>

<h2>11. Data Breach Notification</h2>
<p>
In the event of a data breach affecting personal information, 
affected users will be notified in accordance with applicable law.
</p>

<h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. 
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
</p>

<h2>13. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information 
by contacting us at the email provided above. You may also withdraw consent 
for data processing by deleting your account within the App.
</p>

<h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App 
after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
</p>

<h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India.
