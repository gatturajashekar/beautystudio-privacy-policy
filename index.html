<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective Date: January 1, 2026</p>

<div class="highlight">
This Privacy Policy describes how Madhu’s Beauty Studio (“we”, “our”, “us”) 
collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects personal data through the 
Madhu Beauty Studio mobile application (“App”).
</div>

<h2>Scope and Acceptance</h2>
<p>
By registering, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood 
this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy. 
Our services are intended for users located in India and are governed by Indian laws.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect personal data directly from you when you register or use our services. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Phone number (used for OTP-based authentication via Firebase Authentication)</li>
<li>Age range (optional, 13–120)</li>
<li>Gender (optional)</li>
<li>Booking history and selected salon services</li>
<li>Loyalty and referral records</li>
<li>Push notification device token (Firebase Cloud Messaging)</li>
<li>Technical log and system metadata processed by secure cloud infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not collect passwords, financial information, biometric identifiers, or precise location data.
</p>

<h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
<p>
Data is collected directly from you during registration and service use. 
Technical metadata may be automatically processed through our cloud service providers 
including Firebase and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for security, monitoring, and operational purposes.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of Processing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secure authentication and account management</li>
<li>Managing salon bookings and service history</li>
<li>Operating the loyalty rewards system</li>
<li>Sending booking confirmations and reminders</li>
<li>Fraud detection and misuse prevention</li>
<li>System monitoring and performance optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not sell personal data or use it for behavioral advertising or profiling.
</p>

<h2>Cloud Infrastructure and International Processing</h2>
<p>
The App operates using Firebase Authentication and Amazon Web Services including 
AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, IAM, and related services. 
These providers may process limited technical data on secure servers that 
may be located outside India. By using the App, you consent to such processing 
under appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or trade personal data. Data may be shared only with trusted 
service providers strictly for operational purposes, including authentication, 
cloud hosting, and notification delivery. Access to user data is restricted 
to authorized personnel under role-based access controls.
</p>

<h2>Service Availability Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
The App is provided on an “as available” basis. While we strive to maintain 
reliable and secure operations, we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. 
Temporary outages may occur due to maintenance, updates, infrastructure 
failures, or third-party service disruptions beyond our control.
</p>

<h2>Security Measures</h2>
<p>
Data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. Cloud databases use encryption at rest. 
Administrative access is protected through secure authentication and role-based access controls. 
Despite these safeguards, no digital platform can guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain personal data only as long as your account remains active or as required 
for legitimate operational or legal purposes. Upon account deletion:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your account enters a short processing window (approximately 1–2 hours)</li>
<li>Core user data and loyalty records are permanently deleted</li>
<li>Limited system logs may be retained temporarily for security compliance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age. 
We rely on user-declared age information and do not independently verify age. 
If we become aware that data of a child under 13 has been collected, 
we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Subject to applicable Indian law, you may:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data</li>
<li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
<li>Request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
<li>Withdraw consent for data processing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Requests may be submitted via email at 
<a href="mailto:madhubeautystudio@gmail.com">madhubeautystudio@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
<p>
In the event of a confirmed data breach affecting personal data, 
we will assess the impact and notify affected users and relevant authorities 
in accordance with applicable law including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes 
will be reflected by updating the effective date above. Continued use 
of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India. 
Any disputes arising shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction 
of the courts located in Hyderabad, Telangana.
