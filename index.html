<h2>1. Who We Are</h2>

This Privacy Policy applies to the Madhu Beauty Studio mobile application (“App”), 
operated by Madhu’s Beauty Studio, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
</p>

<p>

<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>

<ul>

<p>
We do not collect payment card details, biometric identifiers, precise location data, 
or sensitive financial information through the App.
</p>

<h2>3. Technical and Log Information</h2>
<p>
The App operates on secure cloud infrastructure including Firebase Authentication 
and Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and CloudWatch.
These systems may automatically process limited technical metadata such as request 
timestamps, device type, and system logs for security monitoring and service reliability.
This information is used strictly for operational and security purposes.
</p>

<h2>4. Purpose of Processing</h2>
<p>
Your information is processed solely to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable secure user authentication</li>
<li>Manage salon bookings</li>
<li>Send booking confirmations and reminders</li>
<li>Operate the loyalty rewards system</li>
<li>Prevent misuse or fraud</li>
<li>Maintain system security and reliability</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not use your data for advertising profiling, behavioral tracking, or automated decision-making.
</p>

<h2>5. Legal Basis</h2>
<p>
We process personal data based on user consent at registration, performance of requested services, 
legitimate business interests for secure operations, and compliance with applicable laws including 
India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
</p>

<h2>6. Loyalty Program</h2>
<p>
One hundred (100) coins equal ₹1 for redemption within the App. Coins are issued only after completed 
bookings and may be reversed in cases of cancellation, misuse, or technical correction. 
Coins are non-transferable and have no cash value outside the App.
</p>

<h2>7. Notifications</h2>
<p>
The App uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to send booking-related notifications only. 
We do not send promotional marketing notifications. Users may disable notifications 
through their device settings at any time.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>
<p>
All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. Cloud databases use encryption at rest. 
Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel through role-based access controls. 
Administrative access is protected by secure authentication mechanisms.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Retention & Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
Personal data is retained while your account remains active. Users may delete their account 
within the App at any time. Upon deletion request:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The account enters a short processing window (approximately 1–2 hours)</li>
<li>Core account data is permanently removed after this period</li>
<li>Loyalty records are erased</li>
<li>Certain minimal system logs may be retained temporarily for legal or security purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deleted accounts cannot be restored after completion of the deletion process.
</p>

<h2>10. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell or share personal data with third parties for marketing. 
Limited technical data may be processed by trusted infrastructure providers 
such as Firebase and AWS strictly for service operation.
</p>

<h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Cloud infrastructure providers may operate secure data centers outside India. 
By using the App, you acknowledge and consent to such processing under appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age. 
We rely on user-declared age and do not independently verify age information.
</p>

<h2>13. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data 
by contacting us at the email listed above. You may also withdraw consent 
by deleting your account within the App.
</p>

<h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
While we implement reasonable security safeguards, no digital platform can guarantee 
absolute security. Madhu’s Beauty Studio shall not be liable for indirect or consequential 
damages arising from unauthorized access beyond reasonable control.
</p>

<h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App 
after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
